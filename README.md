# Airbnb

### Motivation: 
For this project I choose [_Seattle_](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/version/2#listings.csv) and [_Boston_ ](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) data which were opensource data and performed analysis on affecting factors of listing price and customer rating of Airbnb. 

### Files:
- Main.ipynb: the python notebook that realize the main function 
- listings_boston.csv: Airbnb listings in Boston 
- listings_seattle.csv: Airbnb listings in Seattle

### Libraries:
Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn

### Summary:
Three business questions are answered based on analysis. As a conlusion, the listing price mainly affected by location of the property, both in Seattle and Boston. Property type, room type and number of bedrooms also contributes. In terms of customer rating, the value and cleanliness are the top two factor that correlates the total score. Results are visulaized and presented in the blog.
